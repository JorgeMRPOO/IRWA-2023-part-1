The basic idea is that as a term appears more in the document it becomes more important. On the other side, if we only use pure term counts, longer documents will be favored more. Consider two documents with exactly the same content but one being twice longer by concatenating with itself.  The tf weights of each word in the longer document will be twice the shorter one, although they essentially have the same content.
